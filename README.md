## Notes from Lead Programmer

So this game was build with one intention in mind, because really it was the only scrollable and with graphics game in the class, to make a complete and complex product. I've begun programming at the age of 11-13 because I wanted to create a Five Nights at Freddy's fangame, and I made a lot of progress but overall I never completed it. I did get a lot of beautiful friends and valuable practices in there but I always felt that I never finished anything I proposed to since then. So that's when the idea of making a Metroidvania in a project of the first year of university, which did gave more than one headache to everyone who worked in this and I really apologize for that, really got my ambition to get the best from me.

At the end of the day this is what we gave as Final Project and received a perfect grade, which we still remember to this day.
